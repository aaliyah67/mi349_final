            <h3>Research Proposal on Social Media and Cybersecurity</h3>
            <p class="description">This project was a research Proposal
                about the effects of social media on cybersecurity. Through this proposal,
                I identified how social media can create cybersecurity vulnerabilities. I then
                proposed a solution of creating tools to educate users, resulting in less vulnerabilities.

            <h3>Cloud Networking Project</h3>
            <p class="description">For this project, I worked with a team of 4 to
                design a company that utilizes cloud networking tools. For the first part
                of this project, we designed a full website for our company. Then, 
                we utilized Amazon Web Services (AWS) to successfully deploy and host our website.

            <h3>Research Paper on the Relationship Between the IoT and Cybersecurity</h3>
            <p class="description">For this project, I did research on the
                relationship between the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cybersecurity.
                Through this research, I found that many users of the IoT and IoT devices
                are not aware of how their data is stored, and how to protect their data.
                I discovered that there is a correlation with user awareness and cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
